<p style="text-align: justify;">
It all started during dinner that night. We were all eating silently when my mother started to cry. Just softly, you know. A tear here and a tear there. Father didn’t take any notice. He never did. He just kept eating his fava beans, his eyes fixed on the plate. My sister, Nicole, looked at her mother with fear and uncertainty. You don’t expect much from a seven year-old anyway.  
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I averted my eyes to my plate. You see, I didn’t like to see people cry. It made me… uneasy. Then mother started to mumble incoherently. The crying decreased, and the mumbling started to lose its incoherence as it turned into a steady grumble. She was talking something about… wretchedness and guilt. But father kept eating, and I picked up my pace, eager to finish dinner and go to bed. And then, mother stood up.  
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
“I am talking to you, you insolent bastard! You hear me?! You have devastated me! You hear me, you son of a bitch?” she yelled at my father. Father kept eating. I kept eating. Nicole kept watching, her eyes wide with fear. Mother threw her china plate at father and it missed him by an inch crashing against the wall behind.
The sound was enormous. I closed my ears with my palms. You see, I didn’t like any kind of noise. It made my head pound.  
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
It was then that father reacted. He had this ugly temper, you see. He’d beat up people for nothing. He liked to beat my mother when he was drunk. But that night, he was not drunk. And the less drunk he was, the uglier the temper. He climbed the dining table and started to crawl towards mother on the other end, his bloodshot eyes fixed on her. She was crying uncontrollably, and now started throwing stuff at him.  
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I stumbled out of my seat and ran toward the stairs, and Nicole followed me. We hid inside the first place we could find; our parents’ closet. It was dark inside; the only illumination was from the rays that slipped through the slatted double doors. We squeezed ourselves in a dark corner. My parents were now screaming at the top of their voice, and my head was throbbing with pain. I held my palms tightly against my ears, my head burrowed between my drawn knees. But it did little to keep out the noise. I hated the noise. It made me into something different, you know. It made me something ugly. It was like I was out of control, out of breath.  
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
That’s when Nicole started to cry. She had this horrible way of crying, you know. She’d close her eyes tight and cry as loud as she could. And she’d cry till she was out of breath and her face was red as blood, and then she’d stop for an oxygen-refill and repeat her performance.
As soon as she started to cry, I jumped away, horrified. Then I crept up close, trying to soothe her. “Nikki, it’s alright. Everything will be okay. Mom will be okay. Don’t cry, Nikki, please.” But my words were lost in the cacophony. I was shaking violently. My head was beating like an arrhythmic heart, and the pain was excruciating. There was screaming downstairs, there was screaming upstairs. There was no exit. I looked at Nikki, at the red face, at the exposed teeth and the screaming mouth. I begged her silently to stop. No words came from my mouth.  
</p>

_“You have to stop this, Jimmy.”_  

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I looked around, trying to locate the source. It was just me and the crying child in the dark closet.  
</p>

_“You know you can stop this.”_ It was a whisper. It was coming from me. Somewhere in my head. The voice was soft, gentle and soothing. It flowed gracefully through my head, healing the wounds inside. I closed my eyes, wanting more.  

<p style="text-align: justify;">
But the brutal noise filled up my ears again, and my brain exploded into chaos. I began to cry softly, pleading for the voice to return.  
</p>

_“You have to help yourself, Jimmy. You have to end this,”_ the voice whispered.  

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I nodded, warm tears flowing down my cheeks. Like an obedient child, I stood up and retrieved the brass tube that supported the tie rack. I walked up to Nicole, bent toward her slightly, and started hitting her. I hit her continuously. I hit her on her face. I hit her till that evil mouth of hers couldn’t open again. I hit her till her eyes were filled with blood and the tears were long gone. I hit her till my face was as red with blood as hers.  
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
And then, when I was done, I straightened up, and stared at my masterpiece.  
</p>

_“Beautiful, isn’t it? Let’s go downstairs.”_

<p style="text-align: center;"> # </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
“Mr Moriarty? Are you with us?”  
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The voice startled me back to reality. I looked at the young reporter sitting in front of me. She
looked hot in the red dress. I smiled inwardly, embarrassed at my thoughts. I looked at my wrinkled
hands, and the handcuffs that secured them.  
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
“So are you ready to tell your story? Everything from the start? You seemed lost in some other era,”
the reported said, smiling.  
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I gave her as sexy a smile as my sixty-years-old face could muster.  
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
“Just going through the details again,” I replied, my eyes twinkling.
</p>
